# mqtt-beerkeg-load-cell-sensor

MQTT Bed Sensor/Scales for bed occupancy (although entirely adaptable for anything), for integrating with Home Assistant, OpenHAB, Domoticz and anything else supporting MQTT.

Has remote tare function which you can issue over MQTT if your sensor suffers from drift which many load cells seem to. This saves having to re-start the device everytime you want to tare.
